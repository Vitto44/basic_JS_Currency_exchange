# Simple JS Currency Exchanger

Simple Currency Exchanger. Just JS, HTML and CSS.

## Start

Just add your API key to API_KEY.json

```json
{
  "api_key": "your api key"
}
```

You can get it at [Free Currency App](https://app.freecurrencyapi.com/)

Then Run with Live Server in VS CODE. Running it by simply clicking on HTML will end in CORS error.
